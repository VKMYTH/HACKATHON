git instructions
- download git on ur device if you dont have it to program files it will automatically set it to ur global path if not configure that as well
- go to terminal and enter "cd" and drag and drop the program folder into the terminal. this will auto-populate the path file for u
- next run "git init" to initialize empty git repo
- check status by using "git status"
	- if there are red files present, that means they aren't staged and need to be for a commit
	- type "git add ." to add all the files or specify which files you want to add to staging
	- then run "git status" again to see if the files turn green (meaning they are staged)
- next run a "git commit -m "MESSAGE"" type in any message you want to describe what commit is performed then
- then run a "git log --oneline" to see the commits that were created and where the ehad of the commits is
- finally run "git remote add origin <repo url>". to get repo url create a repo in github and then copy the repo link from the code tab and paste in terminal w that command
- after everything is set, then push the project into github by saying "git push -u origin main" to put it in main branch or whatever default branch u have. it could be master
